# Sentiment Predictive Model

## Description
This project implements a sentiment predictive model based on text input. Given a piece of text, the model predicts the sentiment, classifying it as positive or negative. The model was trained using Amazon Book Reviews from 2014 (c/o http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ and https://github.com/KeithGalli/sklearn/). 

To use it, clone the repository and in a terminal run app.py; make sure to have scikit-learn and flask installed. Then the local server (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000) should have the prediction interface.
